## __*“Enter freely and of your own free will!”*__

I'm Josh Simpson. Currently, I spend my time seeking a BS in Software Development with a Minor in Agriculture, aiming to pursue a career in GIS within Agricultural Technology. My main interest lies in utilizing technology to empower local farming practices, ensuring affordability and supporting family farmers. Outside of tech, I enjoy the outdoors, strong coffee, old motorcycles, and collecting copies of Bram Stoker's Dracula.

I'm currently open to joining new projects!
