- Howdy, I am Josh Simpson
- Currently seeking a BS in Software Development and Minor in Agriculture, hoping to turn that into a career in GIS in Agricultural Technology. 
- I'm most interested in utilizing technology to empower local farming practices, keeping things affordable and empowering the family farmer.
- Outside of tech, I enjoy the outdoors, strong coffee, old motorcycles and Bram Stoker's Dracula.
- I currently am using Java, Python, and HTML/CSS/JS in my day to day life. Focusing more on backend currently.
